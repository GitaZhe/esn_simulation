# ESN_Simulation

The echo state network (ESN),[1][2] is a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer (with typically 1% connectivity). The connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can (re)produce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons. Thus, the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system.

This repository contains codes for simulation of a echo-state network (ESN) at the scale of 500/800 hidden nodes.

The function simulation is in C. The Acceleration is in FPGA and GPU.

The implementation of ESN-based prediction is done on FPGA, using Vivado HLS to automatically generate the RTL kernel.
