# HLS source code for 800 ESN network for pattern generation.

This directory contains source codes for the 800-node echo-state network (ESN).

This ESN has been trained to generate hand written patterns (words) during the offline analysis, while the source code is Vivado HLS code for accelerator that can speed up the inference of the well-trained ESN network.
